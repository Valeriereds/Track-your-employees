# Track-your-employees

## Description

I created this neat Employee Tracker to demonstrate my growing knowledge on creating a database, schema, and seed file in MYSQL, as well as implementing the inquirer package to create working prompts for this project. The hardest part of this endeavor was building the queries. It took a while to figure out the logic between tables, but once I figured it out, the rest of the queries went by easy. Second toughest issue I came across was inserting these queries into prompt questions. It was very difficult figuring out the syntax. Unfortunately, I could not implement the bonus queries in my prompt due to time, but I am proud I figured out the first bit of that problem.
