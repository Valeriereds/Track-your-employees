# Track-your-employees

## Description

I created this neat Employee Tracker to demonstrate my growing knowledge on creating a database, schema, and seed file in MYSQL, as well as implementing the inquirer package to create working prompts for this project. The hardest part of this endeavor was building the queries. It took a while to figure out the logic between tables, but once I figured it out, the rest of the queries went by easy. Second toughest issue I came across was inserting these queries into prompt questions. It was very difficult figuring out the syntax. Unfortunately, I could not implement the bonus queries in my prompt due to time, but I am proud I figured out the first bit of that challenge. I hope whomever stumbles on this humble CLI app will be able to utilize it for whatever employee database they might have.

## Usage



To use this CLI, simply run "npm start" in the terminal line, and you'll be greeted with a list of choices for an employee database tracker. Using the arrow keys, the user can scroll through the list to find the appropriate action. Once the action is highlighted, hit enter, and the user will either be shown the selected database (if the action chosen is VIEW ALL), or prompted to answer questions (if the answer chosen was ADD OR UPDATE). After an action is completed, the user is returned to the original full list of actions. When the user is finished with all their actions, they can choose to end the question prompts by scrolling down to END. Happy Coding!
